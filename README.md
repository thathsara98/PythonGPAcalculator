**Simple GPA Calculator**

The GPA calculator is a Python program designed to assist students in calculating their Grade Point Average (GPA) based on the grades they've received in their courses. The program prompts the user to input their course names along with the corresponding credit hours and letter grades. It then converts the letter grades into numerical values according to the standard GPA scale (e.g., A+ & A=4.0, B+=3.3, etc.), multiplies the grade points by the credit hours for each course, and calculates the overall GPA by dividing the total grade points earned by the total credit hours attempted.

**Key Features:**

1. User Input: The program prompts the user to input their course names, credit hours, and letter grades.
2. Grade Conversion: It converts the letter grades into numerical values according to the GPA scale.
3. Calculation: The program calculates the grade points for each course by multiplying the numerical grade by the credit hours. It then calculates the overall GPA by dividing the total grade points earned by the total credit hours attempted.
4. Output: Finally, the program displays the calculated GPA to the user.
